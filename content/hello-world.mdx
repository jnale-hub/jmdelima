Hi there!

During the pandemic, I didn't know what to do with my life as I still didn't have a concrete dream. I felt like I was wasting a lot of time.

Then I came across this free online course, [CS50 from Harvard University](https://cs50.harvard.edu/). From then, I began to discover coding and computer science, thanks to the very cool instructor, **David J. Malan**.

The course started with the basics of computer science, and I learned about **algorithms**, **data structures**, and even some **web development**. It was challenging but incredibly rewarding. I spent countless hours debugging my code, but the satisfaction of solving a problem was unmatched.

One of the first programs I wrote was a simple **"Hello, World!"** program. It might seem trivial, but it was a significant milestone for me. It marked the beginning of my journey into the world of coding.

As I progressed through the course, I built several projects, including a **web application** and a **simple game**. Each project taught me something new and helped me grow as a programmer.
